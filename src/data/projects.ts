    shortDescription:
      "State-of-the-art fitness facility serving over 2,000 community members",
    fullDescription:
      "We built a modern gymnasium facility in Polonnaruwa District, providing free access to fitness equipment and health programs for the local community. This project has transformed the health and wellness of over 5,000 residents by fostering a culture of fitness and discipline. Sports play a vital role in helping young people in their day-to-day lives, especially with their discipline, mental sharpness, and physicality. These qualities guide them in becoming balanced individuals. Students who are involved in sports become confident adults. Not every individual can achieve this; the DishDiya Foundation is helping bridge this gap by establishing this facility. Specifically, we are building a new Weight Lifting Training Center in Sevanapitiya, Welikanda Division, Polonnaruwa, with the primary beneficiaries being the student athletes of Sevanapitiya Maha Vidyalaya.",
    problem:
      "Limited access to fitness facilities and rising health issues in the community, particularly among youth, have hindered physical development and discipline.",
    solution:
      "A fully-equipped gymnasium with professional trainers, health education programs, and specialized weight-lifting training tailored for student athletes.",
    impact:
      "2,000+ beneficiaries, 40% reduction in obesity rates, youth sports programs established, and enhanced confidence and discipline among Sevanapitiya Maha Vidyalaya student athletes.",
